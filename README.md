## Program Functionality
This program generates multiple example sentences using the input word.

## Reason for Creating the Program
When preparing for the English exam TOEIC, I found it tedious and repetitive to search for example sentences for each word on Google and match them one by one for study. To streamline this process, I automated the process of finding example sentences for words on the server side so that example sentences would immediately pop up when entering a word. Therefore, I could quickly receive English example sentences when needed, reducing the unnecessary time spent on searching.
